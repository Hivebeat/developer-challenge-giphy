Hivebeat Developer Challenge
============================

This is a simple hiring challenge that uses React to interact with the Giphy API

The basic setup and scaffolding of the app is done, so you can focus on the task.

Getting started:
---------------

- Fork this repo
- Clone your new repo
- run `npm install`
- run `node server.js`

This will start a server on http://localhost:3000 and you can start developing in `src/App.js`

The Task:
---------

Create a Single Page application that interacts with the [Giphy API](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI).
You can use the public beta key as authentication.

We want users to be able to do a search on the api, that calls the random enpoint.
Then the app should display the image found.
The app should display a history of 5 images, which it shows on the page.
The history should be clear'able.

That's it! Feel free to dig around or add more flashy stuff :)
